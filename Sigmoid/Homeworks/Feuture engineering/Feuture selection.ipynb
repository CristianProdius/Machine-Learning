    "\n",
    "Feature importance is a measure of the impact of different features on the predictions made by a machine learning model.\n",
    "Importance Measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Various methods exist to measure feature importance, each answering slightly different versions of the question.\n",
    "Permutation importance is highlighted for its speed, widespread usage, and consistency with desired properties of a feature importance measure.\n",

    "How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutation importance is calculated after a model has been trained.\n",
    "The model remains unchanged during the process.\n",
    "It involves randomly shuffling the values in a single column of the dataset and observing the impact on prediction accuracy.\n",
    "The more a column shuffle affects accuracy, the more important the feature in that column.\n",

    "Shuffle values in a single column and make predictions.\n",
    "Measure the deterioration in the loss function due to the shuffle.\n",
    "Repeat for each column in the dataset."
